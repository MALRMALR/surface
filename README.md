##SURFACE
<br>

### OVERVIEW
SURFACE is an interactive musical toy that allows users the ability to play
various chords / pads with the keyboard.  The user's immediate interaction with
the app via playing the keyboard will change the visualization that accompanies
each 'session.'  The user is able to tweak the structure of each of the four
geometric shapes that are rendered to the page as well as gain, reverb and filter
frequency audio parameters.
